We were planning to have in our website an indicator for farmers or researchers to understand the dosage limit of different grades of fertilizers that we are trying to create for their farm lands.  N-P-K are the macro nutrients required by every soil in specific amounts which lead to soil health improvement. So we were thinking that in our Saroja.earth website we want to add some indicators like, N% in soil, P% in soil, K% in soil, which will be then compared with different brands of fertilizers that we are trying to create. the farmers will be able to know by inputting those specific information to get an estimated dosage limit per acre for each fertilizer brand. so this is another task you could think upon and suggest the process for such representation in the saroja.earth website may be under the product section. So Saroja.earth will be a one-stop solution for farmers unsure about which brand to use and what would be the dosage limit which will be defined by the NPK% in soil. Sharing a doc on NPK and the different grades of Fertilizer that we are trying to create or promote to give you the context. Trying to keep it as simple and user-friendly as possible and not involving too many parameters.
